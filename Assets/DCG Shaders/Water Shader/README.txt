BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:

1) This Water package is optimized to use it in deferred rendering mode and linear color space.
2) The two "waves normal maps" are independent one of each other BUT they are additive to each other, so if you put the two on 1f most likely you will get weird results. nice values are between 0.1f and 0.6f.
3) The reflection will work very, very slowly on mobile target platforms, however the water its still compatible with mobile platforms.(to try to solve this, set the mirror reflection to a lower resolution, maybe 16, or even 8).
4) The new Displacement mode is driven by a calculation of the main wave's normal map texture channels, so try always to use this map as your larger main texture, for details use the detail normal map section.
5) The Sine related variables of the displacement sections are for a constant "ping-pong" movement in the Y axis of the mesh, this in addition with the waves displacement gives a sensation of live sea.
6) if you are trying to do a calm water(cave,lake,etc) just try to not use the main "Waves normal map" section or use it in a very subtle way.
7) if you are planning to do Rivers, or some kind of quick flow of water you should check out my other product "DCG River Shader".
8) The Fade level variation of the water color stands for how much levels of grading will have the water from the most clear part to the darkest part.
9) The tint of the water is calculated by a complex algorithm to try to emulate a real-life fluid capability of reflect or absorb Wavelenght light rays with a given water color in addition with a density factor.
    with this you can create from nice and clear waters to dark and dense oil-like fluids.
10) Enjoy :) !
